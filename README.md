# Analysis of the Bilingual Arithmetic Task

This is the R project I created to analyze the bilingual arithmetic task, part of the masters study titled "Forty-One Plus Twenty-Four is...: An Investigation On Arithmetic Processing In Late Bilinguals With Low And High Proficiency". The study was conducted by me, João Luiz Coelho, under the advisorship of Prof. Dr. Mailce Borges Mota in the Programa de Pós-Graduação em Inglês graduation program at UFSC.

The study was approved by the ethics committee from Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina under the protocol number 48291521.5.0000.0121 (CAAE).
